## Bus Mall

A page for marketers to gauge interest in specific products in order to determine what should be in their print catalog.


The page displays products from the bus-mall in sets of threes. The user picks the product that interests them most. The application keeps track of how many times a product has been clicked and how many times it's appeared. By default, it lets the user pick from 25 sets of products, then displays the results it's collected in a chart and list.

The number of sets the user it presented before it tabulates results can be changed by changing the value of the maxVotes variable in the top section of global variables in 'app.js'.
